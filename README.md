## üíª Usage (Self hosting)

This section details how to use RepoDocs.

**1. Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
* A database (as specified in the server's `dbConfig.js`).

**2. Setup:**

* Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Samiul-Islam-123/RepoDocs.git
  ```

* Navigate to the client and server directories:

  ```bash
  cd RepoDocs/client
  npm install  # or yarn install
  cd ../server
  npm install # or yarn install
  ```


* **Database Setup:** Configure your database connection details in `server/config/dbConfig.js`.

* **Environment Variables:** Copy the `.env.example` file in the client directory and rename it to `.env`. Fill in any required environment variables.


**3. Running the application:**

Start both the client and server simultaneously. Consider using two separate terminal windows for a smoother experience.

* **Client:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev # or yarn dev
   ```

* **Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start # or yarn start
   ```

This will launch the application on `http://localhost:3000` (client) and start the server on a specified port (check your `server/index.js`).
